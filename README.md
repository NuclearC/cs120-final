# CS120 Group Project assignment
This repository contains the source code for the group project assignment for CS120 'Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming' course. 

## Topic
The project is a multiplayer top-down shooter game. Each player controls a tank (with WASD keys for movement and cursor for aiming). Players can shoot projectiles with left mouse button. When player's tank gets hit by a projectile from another player, their health decreases, and eventually, when it reaches 0, they die. The game shall have multiple gamemodes, such as FFA Deathmatch and Battle Royale (last man standing). It is also planned to add different types of projectiles (guided and self-guided).
